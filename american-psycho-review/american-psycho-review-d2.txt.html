<h2>American Psycho on Second Order Society</h2>
<p>
American Psycho concludes with the elation of a character who has experienced the manic killing of dozens of innocents, being forgiven by the perfect aloofness of his colleagues; one so perfect as to be materially delusion - yet his guilt and escape from consequence could not be more real.

<p>
A composition of the vivid, dark, humorous reflections of the highly privileged and inherited class of Wall Street financier plods towards a surreal conclusion which serves to make some  interpretation of symbolism necessary to find meaning in the film - lest the subject of the film be literally about psychological delusion. Considering the steps taken throughout the film to highlight its superficial, detached and socially aloof setting, it is reasonable to limit one's interpretation of the film's events towards the critique of Wall Street, or what this review will refer to more generally as <i>Second Order Capitalism.</i>

<p>
Second Order Capitalism is the management of financial tools - the meta-business layer, in contrast to First Order Capitalism which provides direct material value to one or more parties. Second Order Capitalism, despite it's abstractions of first order value, has very real and powerful effects on economies and societies.

<p>
What it takes to socialize within the kingdom of Second Order Capitalism, the film's subject, Patrick Bateman, cannot stomach. Most grief caused by Second Order Capitalism is materially absolved and spiritually inconsequential the sufficiently unobservant. What it takes to evade such Karma is the emergent culture of cynicism, and more deeply, ignorance, the setting of the film is steeped in - what makes Bateman a reflective character is his amorality combined with an inability to authentically participate in a setting neccisitant of ignorance - he is functionally autistic.

<p>
Bateman tells the audience straight away he is a shell with no emotions; this performance following through the fourth wall is his introduction to the audience, but to Bateman it is an affirmation. 

<p>
His ability to socially navigate his environment is clearly and repeatedly demonstrated as a conscious act; Bateman is self aware. His self-awareness, determination and self-reinforcement betray that Bateman's entire state, including his <i>cynical ignorance</i>, is decidedly self-maintained. Bateman understands the necessity of ignorance, and his psychosis stems from his conscious pursuit of it. His long morning routine to maintain his physical mask is appropriately capped off by this psychological affirmation. 

<p>
If Bateman truly had no emotions, as he tells himself, he would not be a killer of passion. Though carefully hidden, his suppressed emotions are as integral to his facade as the shows he puts on - ignorance is part of his act, and damaging his own mind to be more authentically detached is a sacrifice actively pursued. His business may require such little humanity, but the relationships serve to test Bateman throughout the film and burn through his superficiality much more quickly.

<p>
Batemans's facade, in success and failure, is so shallow that those watching the film cannot help but feel visceral moral superiority over that exclusive society which is materially and powerfully superior to most all - that is, to laugh. The high stakes of such shallow interactions are driven home and made all the more ridiculous by serving as the motivations for Bateman's killings.

<p>
The killings are often extreme comedy - the emotional mishaps of the main character getting him into all sorts of trouble, but unless the meaning from the film is an allegory on how to be a less incompetent serial killer, then it is not murder that the film is about, and the fact that the literal killings, are revealed as delusion while his burden of consequence and it's unreciprocation linger, hints that the murders are a dramatized stand-in for some other externality.

<p>
This review posits that killings are symbolic of, and the film is a critique of, societies defined by Second Order Capitalism. When one understands the distinct trait of Bateman compared to his setting is self-awareness, the immense anticipation of consequence his 'killings' give him, going so perfectly unreciprocated by his peers to the point of being materially a delusion, reflect a lower limit on how emotionally and materially unaccountable his world truly is.

<p>
Refined ignorance enhancing common greed and power describe the pathologies Bateman struggles to navigate. But it is not because Bateman is a bleeding heart, he is not even a deeply flawed or corrupted moralist. Batemen's difficulty fitting in is purely technical: his friends and colleagues are happily adapted towards ignorance, and Bateman, if only to serve as a foil, is deeply introspective. 

<p>
Bateman's final message to the audience highlights his unfulfilled spiritual need to be held accountable. The self-awareness is strong enough to be revealing to the audience, yet he concludes by throwing it away. Bateman has been self-aware for the duration of the film, and it is only in conclusion that it is demonstrated directly to the audience; it is what was missing from Batemen's introduction and affirmation at the beginning of the film, yet both end in a conscious pursuit of ignorance.

<p>
"There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis; my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing."

<p>
Financiers of inherited status served a relevant environment devoid of guilt during the film's release, and Bateman's dedication to ignorance and the high cost he is willing to pay foreshadowed the survival of such amoral structures to this day. Informed readers may already be aware that the personal benefits of being free from guilt in general, if only through ignorance, now pervade more than just Wall Street.
