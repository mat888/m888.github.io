<h2> American Psycho on Second Order Society </h2>

<p>
American Psycho concludes with Patrick Bateman's disbelief: the fresh anticipation of repercussions from manically slaying dozens of innocents is plainly forgiven by the perfect aloofness of his colleagues; aloofness so eclipsing as to render his atrocities literal delusion.

The rug is pulled from underneath Bateman and the audience at the same time - the focus of the film instantly narrows towards all that is left which is credibly and materially real in the story: wallows of guilt within bewilderingly sudden and complete absolvement.

<p>
A composition of the vivid, dark, humorous reflections of the privileged and inherited class of Wall Street plods towards a surreal conclusion which voids itself of the most important physical events of the film. Lest the subject of the film is literally about psychological delusion, the impetus on symbolic interpretation could hardly be any stronger.

Considering the underhanded critiques throughout which highlight its superficial and socially aloof setting, it is reasonable to conclude that Bateman's delusion is a projection of the difference between his self-awareness and the sophisticated ignorance he failed to assimilate into.

<p>
Bateman's environment is that of <i>Second Order Capitalism</i>.

It is the management of financial tools - the meta-business layer, in contrast to <i>First Order Capitalism</i>, a simple material exchange between parties.

Second Order Capitalism has very real and powerful effects on economies and societies, but is abstracted to such a degree that every party is no longer able to fully understand or consent to exchanges they may be involved in.

Rather than a merchant selling a good for an agreed upon price, a stock in the enterprise is priced according to its relationship to the broad market of stock in all public enterprise and the derivative speculative markets which may settle large gambles on the future judgement on these enterprises based on their complex relationship with each other, central bank policy, and public perception - resource distribution in the most abstract terms with big winners and losers.

<p>
Real value is being exchanged in these systems, and that value is ultimately backed by the value of businesses these systems derive their trades from.

But the public business owner is, comparatively, a rube to all of this; despite this, their holdings in their own company make them implicit in this higher order world of public finance where they are destined to perform worse than experts employing complex financial tools.

And this is the direction of Bateman's guilt, that he is a systematic leech on what prosperity simple, first order capitalism grants.

<!--
Where the complexity lies is in and of itself the issue with moral abstractions of all kinds: the immediate exchange for one party is clear, but the counter-party externalities may be convoluted, obscured and dispersed.

The romantic notion of capitalism where all actors understand and consent to all exchanges is lost, and the economy tends towards a series of relationships too complex to be fully understood, ripe with opportunity to profit at the expense of the truly productive simpleton.
-->

<p>
The financial abstractions of Bateman's setting are either so dense as to render the nature of exchanges nebulous even to those critically in profit, or are sufficiently complex that by simply not thinking too hard one renders such exchanges opaque to themselves; the film appropriately omits the specifics of the finance lest it serve to demonstrate social status important to the plot.

Thus for most characters in the film, their soul is saved primarily thanks to their ignorance - more sophisticated tend towards cynicism.

It is demonstrated clearly and consistently that Bateman is especially more thoughtful and aware of his role than his peers, and that he uniquely suffers as a result.

This unique trait of Bateman's is his innate character flaw which prevents him from contentedly playing along in a culture of turning the other way, but it is also his most redeeming trait, as it forces him to satire the hollowness of his surroundings.

<p>
Bateman's dissection of his world is incessant and compulsive, that a character of his nature could progress so far in such a culture is fantastical; his inherited role at his father's company explains the discrepancy and allows the character to serve as an out of place demon and Trojan Horse for critique.

His latent autism combined with his obligations to succeed in a culture necessitating the ability to relax one's conscience pushes Bateman directly towards what his peers so effortlessly avoid.

It is in this sense that Bateman is innocent - his psychopathy may be no more blamed on his inability to adapt towards casual evil as it may on the existence of said evil itself; that Bateman's crimes are materially delusion solidifies his status as a victim.

<!--What makes Bateman uniquely unable to cope is his inability to authentically participate in a setting neccisitant of these traits - he instead is neurotically determined and imparedely self-aware thus requiring great lengths on his part even just to tolerate his surroundings.

< p >
However, from Bateman's perspective up to the end of the film, he is a conscious perpetrator.

His psychopathy is downstream of his condition and is demonstrated to be an act itself.

Where most interpretations of his character see obviously that he puts on an act of normalcy for his obtuse peers, his real mask is psychopathy itself.

Bateman tells the audience straight away he is "illusory,"; "I simply am not there;" this message through the fourth wall is his introduction to the audience, but to Bateman it is affirmation, not observation; it is how one who must navigate his relationships consciously and neurotically understands what is required of him in his hollow environment.

And given his ability to so effortlessly socialize through calculated behavior near this point in the film, it is somewhat convincing that Bateman is as hollow as he presents his narrations.
-->

<p>
But just like Bateman puts on an act for his colleagues, so too does he for the camera and himself, which serve as one entity.

Bateman tells the audience early on he is "illusory,"; "I simply am not there;" this message through the fourth wall is his introduction to the audience, but to Bateman it is affirmation.

This affirmation is appropriately interwoven as narration while the audience witnesses the carefully planned morning routine in service his visual presentation - it is the internal preparation taking place alongside the external.

Bateman's persona, including his own attempt at hollowness, is decidedly self-maintained and unnatural; it is an analytically composed identity designed to allow him to fit in.

The great irony is that his meticulously crafted identity built off of an extreme thoughtfulness and awareness is meant to imitate one the opposite of Bateman's true nature - this disconnect is what ultimately drives him to his manic, periodic climaxes.

<p>
And if his claim to extreme stoicism remain convincing, one only has to cite that Bateman is obviously a killer of passion to find incredulity in his self-reflections.

Those are the obvious examples due to the fact that the nature of his killings are fraught with emotion, but his self-affirmations are even weaker: the famous scene demonstrating his suppressed emotional breakdown at the relative excellence of his colleagues' business cards reveals how little it may take to make Patrick Bateman feel very present and alive despite his earlier assurance to the camera and himself of his hollow and illusory nature.

Further exacerbating his fragile state, Bateman's own contrived performance only serves to torment his mental state even more.

<p>
His whispers and whimpers for help are masked, not by Bateman, but by his setting - even in moments of civil vulnerability the exposure of Bateman's hidden self is never considered of special concern until it is too late - these rare, intimate moments where kindness is extended Bateman's direction are, for him, always soured, cosmically taunted, by his counterpart's mistaking of Bateman's extreme condition for the more routine qualms of the Wall Street lifestyle, and even practical jokes.

<p>
<!--
Despite the fact that these moments tear through his facade, Bateman pursues them, subconsciously desperate to remain in touch with his humanity.
-->
Bateman's act, in success and failure, is so shallow that those watching the film cannot help but feel visceral moral superiority over that exclusive society which is materially and powerfully superior to most all - for the man that is able to outsmart those most adept at exploitation is himself in many ways pathetic; this easy catharsis over financial elites gives the film its humor.

The high stakes of such shallow interactions are driven home and made all the more ridiculous by serving as the motivations for Bateman's equally obscene killings, but unless the meaning from the film is an allegory on how to be a less incompetent serial killer, then it is not murder that the film is about, and the fact that the literal killings are revealed as delusion while their burden of consequence and it's unreciprocation linger, tells us that the murders are a symbolic of a less literal externality.

<p>
The fourth wall of the film is broken not just through Bateman's narration to the audience, but in a deeper sense is broken from the understanding that the material core of the film is not just the enhanced imagination of the viewers, as all films are, it is similarly unreal to <i>the main character</i> - in this sense a manically deranged financial elite is one of the most relatable characters in cinema.

The fantasy is commensurate between Bateman and the audience by the end of the film; those events end up as symbolic and immaterial to him as they were to us.

These projections of Bateman can be posited as realizations of guilt and symbolism for the immense first order externalities of Second Order Capitalism which Bateman and his cohort benefit from.

<p>
When one understands the distinct trait of Bateman compared to his setting is self-awareness, the intense anticipation of reprisal for his 'killings' ("we made a killing on trades today," if you like puns), going so perfectly unreciprocated by his peers to the point of being materially a delusion, reflect a limit on how emotionally and materially accountable his world truly is, and it is this unaccountability and spectrum between cynicism and ignorance which the is the heart of the film's ridicule.

His difficulty fitting in is purely technical: his friends and colleagues are happily adapted towards ignorance, and Bateman, if only to serve as a foil, is compulsively self-aware.

<p>
Bateman's final message to the audience alludes to his unfulfilled spiritual need to be held accountable, though he is forced to concede he is not guilty of murder, guilt remains - if his delusions are projections then the source of his guilt comes from his facilitation of financial abstractions which coldly and invisibly harvests more from trickery than it does from service.

The self-awareness is strong enough to be revealing to the audience, yet his interpretations on the his own self-reflection concludes in forced cynical ignorance - the reapplication of his psychological mask:

<!--
Bateman has been self-aware for the duration of the film, and it is only in conclusion this trait is demonstrated directly to the audience; it is what was missing from Bateman's introductory affirmation, yet both are wrapped in the conscious pursuit of psychosis:
-->

<p>
<i>There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis; my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.</i>

<h3>
Afterword
</h3>

<p>
Financiers of inherited status served a relevant environment devoid of guilt for the film's story, and Bateman's dedication to ignorance and cynicism as the cost worth paying foreshadowed the survival of such goal oriented immorality well into the following decades. The social benefits of being free from guilt and accountability, if only through ignorance, now bleed into more than just Wall Street, more than just elites; those most vocal against of such obvious examples are not themselves resistant to the underlying trap between cynicism and ignorance of their second order lifestyle; they are often jealous.
