<h2>Please Excuse The Young Men</h2>
<p>
What Jordan Peterson and trendy transgenderism share is function as release valves for frustration caused by the failures of young men to meet the standards of previous generations.

Each has independent justifications for existence, but they broadly represent two classes of excuse: "I wasn't taught right" and "I'm not treated right."

Both, when stated so simply, are correct - yet both in practice are often misguided and juxtaposed.

<p>
Jordan Peterson is right when he explains his own success: young men are desperate to improve themselves.

Peterson offers orientations of mind which promise improvement and are novel; the mix of archaic wisdom with modern observation can't help but be fresh.

But the critics of Peterson are correct as well; his life advice boils down to somewhat obvious or traditionally accepted practices: 'clean your room,' 'tell the truth...'

These reminders have value to those who have forgotten and Peterson's ability to contextualize the current moment are what make them relevant, but it is the novelty in exhortation of ancient morals applied to the anti-archiac society that is the most compelling.

<p>
Likewise, the advice to "be one's self" taken to the extremes of transgenderism offers a novel contextualization of trite advice.

Like Peterson, the reasoning that such prescriptions may be swallowed anew is the fresh contextualization; the reason it will work now when it didn't before.

Though both movements hold valuable truth, they are applied too broadly and too desperately; a truth itself is not a panacea; it is only from a great misunderstanding of the source of suffering that such inaffectual solutions are so amplified.

As trendy transgenderism pushes greater absurdities, it is a certain derivation of what Peterson started, popular and shallow which reveals the cracks when taking "I was taught wrong" to the extreme; that is, the rise of videos offering numerical lists of life advice draws one to the conclusion that today's young men <i>yearn</i> for excuses.

<p>
Of course, the young men compelled by either conception ("I wasn't taught right", "I'm not treated right") do not, in the midst of it, perceive themselves as searching for scapegoats.

Victimhood and lust for mentorship are easily justified, but genuine victims are never intentionally so, and so few young men actually take what mentorship is available to them; these are not proactive approaches, they are coping strategies.

These videos of life advice are the beginning of fully processed, factory produced excuse making on behalf of viewers identified with their not having been taught right.

For every piece of advice with marginal value, a feeling of discovery in the desperate takes place: "Ah! This is what was wrong with me. When I fix this, my life will turn around. I couldn't succeed before because <i>I was taught wrong.</i>"

<p>
Yet unlike Jordan Peterson, who builds history crossing theories of behavior and psychology to derive his everyday advice, a listicle of life advice is undisguised buckshot - yet young men are so often barn walls desperate for any rationalization of their circumstance as to uncritically accept a series of guesses as profound wisdom.

And, like Peterson, the content is for the most part not useless, deceptive or composed in bad faith; there are surely many competent or wise people who can benefit from such advice, but it must be said that the core suffering driving people to such distillations will not be resolved by them, not for everyone, even if they can follow the advice.

Re-finished contextualizations on old advice serve to update its revelevancy, but when starved for wisdom these updates carry heavy baggage: they seem to explain why the advice hasn't yet solved one's every problem.

It can explain why, in the mind's of the desperate, why such advice didn't bear fruit before and give hope that a new interpretation hand-crafted for the moment will, allowing the delusion: "This new interpretation will work eventually, and it is because I didn't have this before that I could not become happy and fulfilled -" an excuse more than a solution, to keep believing in broad advice suited for prosperous times, in which most are not participating in.
 
<p>
Victimhood as an identification is so obviously an ideology of excuse that elaboration is hardly necessary.

But it is not, as many argue, wholly irrelevant - for the intuition that one is being oppressed is today true.

But the patented excuse making of either side shrouds the true nature of this oppression. 

<p>
It is of course a mix of the two delusions which is the truth: one must improve oneself in order to collectively regain respect for themselves and thus ire at the ever weakening status of common men.

The idea in the minds of these dried out mental adosclescents that they may out-compete enough of their peers in order to ascend to an elite class devoid of struggle is no observation worthy of an "aha!" - that new contextualizations are required to inspire this shows how meaningless such cynical and processed 'self-improvement' culture becomes.

To become more at the expense of others is to become more individual and less human. 

<p>
Modern man should not expect an easier life for becoming a better person; the need for such people to contest standing power is so desperate that one should expect being a truly good person in this day will be the most difficult and fulfilling of paths one may direct their life.

For the suffering which drives young men to excuse themselves from the standards of the previous century will not be solved for each man independently, but through the collective realization of wisdom, then power.

<p>
Please excuse the young men from the standards of the richest and most out of touch parent generation who debted their lifestyle from the future, from the delusion that hard work will necessarily lead to an easy life, that great individual prosperity awaits each of them, and the deep impression of failure that comes from a materially poor lifestyle ideologically embedded in the delusion that nothing has changed and the situation is improving.

Collectively withdraw from such ideology, and the absurdity and isolation caused by dogmatic self-criticism in a world where critique belongs aimed towards so few will be all but obvious.

"I was taught wrong," "I am treated wrong" are coping strategies; painkillers for abuse - not solutions for it.

<p>
Politicians, bankers and lobbyists who devalue your savings, addict you to gambling your time, money and attention, lie to you and protect themselves at the expense of your collective future while hypnotizing you to rage at the small differences in one another.

The rage is futile because it is never truly directed at the problem, but the late-stage buckshot excuse making which ties one to apathetically blame themselves is becoming too clear too ignore - and I will eventually not need to convince anyone to take this next natural step of redirecting their ire away from oneself towards a system which shoulders its struggle unto its weakest.
