<h1>
	How Network Effect Affects Blockchain
</h1>

<p>
If someone were to ask me, earnestly, why Bitcoin is the best digital currency, I'm not sure I could boil down my reasoning to anything more complicated than "it has network effect, and that's important for security."

Security in blockchain is like liquidity on exchanges or the amount of users on a social media platform: it comes from being the first popular version of something, it is difficult to transfer, is not directly related to the design, and eclipses all other aspects.

The network effect in these activities is the key feature; the platform which can pull ahead at the start compounds its dominance against decently superior platforms without it.

In Bitcoin network effect is important not just so users can transact between a large cohort of familiar and ready participants, but because the objective measure of network security grows with valuation, making it more valuable, and more secure, and more valuable, and more secure...


<p>
For most platforms, the user is not invested past the time they spend with it - so seeing the creators and stakeholders in those platforms conjure narratives explaining why their platform deserves its network effect is easily ignored or recognized as some sort of disingenuous marketing speak.

People understand that they use Twitter because it is where most other people are online; other traits are well ignored.

But Bitcoin is a little different; people who 'use' Bitcoin are most often financially invested in it, thus, the narratives for its dominance are naturally created and clung to - but is it the specificities of the Bitcoin protocol or the first-mover advantage which can take more credit for Bitcoin's network effects? The 'community' at large, like any stakeholder, is convicted on the former.


<p>
The natural place to begin is where Bitcoin itself most famously hard-forked, the blocksize wars starting in 2015.

This was not Bitcoin competing against new blockchains, but Bitcoin making decisions on what configuration it would embody going forward, namely, how much data each block would contain.

Network effects compound - so whichever Bitcoin implementation won initially would eventually dominate.

Those supporting the narrative of the dominating fork (known simply as 'Bitcoin') use these ideological conflicts as strong evidence that the protocol specifics of the dominating fork was the only variable at play, thus deserving of it's eventual network effect.

And to an extent that view is justified - though other, more social factors were at play, the core disagreement was in configuration difference of the various Bitcoin hard forks.

The now dominating version of Bitcoin was initially favored based on idealism around protocol specifications.

<p>
That does not mean the reasoning was sound.

Much time has elapsed since the dominating fork's monopoly on security was secured, and much has been learned about blockchain economics.

If it were the case that the theory and results of natural experiments available today made a stronger case for a now minority fork - it wouldn't matter, just like how a Twitter clone with videos that loaded twice as fast won't takeover.

The key feature is one primarily dependent on network effect, not any theoretical superiority.

If true fundamental superiority is going to surmount the network effect of Bitcoin, it cannot be marginal improvement, but eclipsing improvement - a great migration must be worth the journey.

<p>
Identifying improvement in blockchain protocols which can overcome the dominance predecessors requires knowing the difference between traits which a dominating platform deserves pride over, and ones which are incidental and forgiven in light of that domination - blockchain projects, including Bitcoin, are notorious for whitewashing their tradeoffs. 

Judging blockchain design requires the wisdom to discern whether outcomes are the result of engineering decisions or network effect.

The dominating fork of Bitcoin has interest to believe that every aspect is deserving of its current network effects, that if every blockchain were to begin again on equal footing but with today's knowledge that Bitcoin would still be the clear winner, but in reality much of the objective superiority of Bitcoin comes from recognition and security rather than its engineering.

These traits are not carried over, even to exact clones of Bitcoin, meaning obvious improvements to the protocol in theory will not so easily bear fruit.

Many a Bitcoin maximalist acknowledge that network effect more than makes up for theoretical protocol shortcomings, but to claim that such fundamental improvements exist which make up for the burden of bootstrapping a new network would oust one from such a tribe.

<p>
So why doesn't Bitcoin just upgrade to the best protocol and carry its network effect with it?

For the simple reason that change itself is a justifiable source of anxiety for a network which holds so much value in its stable track record.

Since classic blockchain consensus bargains between a three-way tradeoff, decisions which shift one's position in that space are inherently complicated and require careful deliberation - since Bitcoin is attempting to remain free of the implications of central control, it avoids such deliberation through its culture of immutability.

<p>
There is no incremental path to domination in volume-dependent networks; the incumbent must begin a dominator.

Examine the weapons Saito wields against the inferiorities of distributed ledger technology at large. When you can exhortate against Ethereum, Bitcoin, and their 'replacements' alike with a solution worthy of paying the price to migrate networks, and their effects, you will have understood blockchain past the ideology of the currently dominant networks.
